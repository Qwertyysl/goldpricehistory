akaun MIGA-i saya untuk mendapatkan semula bayaran ejen (wakalah) yang tertunggak?
J26: Ya. Bank akan menghantar tiga peringatan kepada anda – peringatan pertama, kedua, dan
ketiga (terakhir). Jika anda gagal untuk membuat pembayaran amaun yang tertunggakdalam
tempoh 7 hari dari tarikh peringatan terakhir dihantar, Bank akan menjual baki emas yang

transaksi tersebut. Jika terdapat lebihan daripada hasil jualan, Bank akan
mengkreditkannya ke dalam akaun CASA anda.

Maybank2u pada harga pilihan anda atau harga yang dinyatakan, serta menentukan tempoh
matang (tarikh luput) pesanan tersebut sehingga 1 bulan.
Sekiranya jualan dan/atau belian pada harga pilihan atau harga yang dinyatakan tidak
sepadan dalam tempoh pesanan masa depan (dari tarikh permohonan sehingga tarikh luput)
yang ditentukan oleh anda, anda mengakui dan bersetuju bahawa pesanan masa depan yang
dibuat oleh anda akan dibatalkan dan tidak dijalankan oleh Bank.
S29: Apakah risiko yang terdedah kepada MIGA-i ini?
J29: 1. Risiko Pasaran: Pelbagai faktor akan memberi kesan kepada nilai emas MIGA-i, termasuk
keadaan pasaran, sentimen pelabur dan keyakinan, kadar keuntungan, kadar pertukaran
mata wang, kadar inflasi, perniagaan dan ekonomi, politik, kewangan, sosial, alam sekitar
dan lain-lain kejadian tempatan dan global.
2. Risiko Harga: Harga emas MIGA-i bergantung kepada pergerakan dalam pasaran emas.
Nilai rujukan tersebut mungkin berubah-ubah dan perubahan pada harga tersebut yang boleh
mengakibatkan harga, tahap atau nilai memberi kesan negatif kepada kepentingan anda dan
pulangan MIGA-i.
3. Risiko Pulangan atau Pelaburan: Anda terdedah kepada perubahan nilai rujukan tersebut
antara waktu anda membeli emas dan waktu penjualan. Prestasi masa lalu bukan penentu
pulangan masa depan. Pulangan emas adalah dari kenaikan atas pembelian awal dan
bergantung kepada keadaan pasaran emas dunia dan tempatan yang tidakmenentu.
Bagaimanapun, pulangan tidak dijamin sementara risiko potensi kerugian adalah tinggi dan
besar jika dan ketika harga emas jatuh.
